# Clinical NLP Toolkit
Developed during an internship at ECD Software as part of a project collaboration with Turkcell.
A curated collection of Jupyter notebooks and resources for building, fine-tuning, and evaluating clinical NLP models.
Includes:

- RAG-powered chatbots tailored to Turkish clinical notes
- Diagnosis classifiers from de-identified patient data
- Experiments with multiple large language models (LLMs) (Mistral 7B, Falcon RW 1B, BERTurk)
## Main Features

- Fine-tuning of LLM's **Mistral 7B**, **Falcon RW 1B**, and **BERTurk** for clinical NLP tasks.
- Multi-model chatbot implementations with domain-specific context retrieval, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for more accurate medical Q\&A..
- Diagnosis classification based on clinical notes.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ClinicalChatbot_mistral7b.ipynb** | LLM-based clinical chatbot built using the Mistral 7B model. Handles patient-doctor style question answering with domain-specific context retrieval. |
| **DiagnosisClassifier_BerTurk.ipynb** | Fine-tuned BERTurk model for medical diagnosis classification from clinical notes. |
| **finetuned_falcon_rw_1b.ipynb** | LLM-based clinical chatbot, built with fine-tuned Falcon RW 1B model on Turkish medical text data. |
| **hamza_xl_modeli.ipynb** | Chatbot implementation using the Hamza XL model hosted on Hugging Face. |
| **clinical_notes.csv** | Dataset of 500 syntheticly created Turkish clinical notes used for training and evaluation (de-identified). |

## ðŸ“Š Models & Frameworks

- [Mistral 7B](https://mistral.ai/) â€” general-purpose LLM adapted for clinical dialogue.
- [BERTurk](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) â€” fine-tuned for medical text classification.
