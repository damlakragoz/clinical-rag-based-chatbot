# Clinical NLP Toolkit: RAG-Based Chatbots Specializing on Turkish Clinical Notes and Diagnosis Classifier

A collection of Jupyter notebooks and resources for building, fine-tuning, and evaluating clinical natural language processing (NLP) models.  
Includes chatbots, diagnosis classifiers, and experiments with multiple large language models (LLMs) on Turkish clinical notes.

## Main Features

- Fine-tuning of LLM's **Mistral 7B**, **Falcon RW 1B**, and **BERTurk** for clinical NLP tasks.
- Multi-model chatbot implementations with domain-specific context retrieval, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for more accurate medical Q\&A..
- Diagnosis classification based on retrieved clinical notes.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ClinicalChatbot_mistral7b.ipynb** | LLM-based clinical chatbot built using the Mistral 7B model. Handles patient-doctor style question answering with domain-specific context retrieval. |
| **DiagnosisClassifier_BerTurk.ipynb** | Fine-tuned BERTurk model for medical diagnosis classification from clinical notes. |
| **finetuned_falcon_rw_1b.ipynb** | LLM-based clinical chatbot, built with fine-tuned Falcon RW 1B model on Turkish medical text data. |
| **hamza_xl_modeli.ipynb** | Chatbot implementation using the Hamza XL model hosted on Hugging Face. |
| **clinical_notes.csv** | Dataset of 500 syntheticly created Turkish clinical notes used for training and evaluation (de-identified). |
